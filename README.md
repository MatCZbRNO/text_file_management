# list_management
You can use this code to manage lists in a text file. Before using, read the README file.

1. The code and the list of players have to be in the same folder
2. The folder with the code and the list has to be on desktop
3. Rewrite the list of players if you want

4. When saving the list of players to desktop, you can' t load it from desktop immediatelly
5. If you want to load the file you just saved to the desktop, you' ll have to restart the code
6. You can load any file with '.txt' extension

7. My natural language isn' t english so you might not understand why some variables are named like they are
8. This file or the code might have some grammar mistakes so I' m sorry if there are some
9. Enjoy
